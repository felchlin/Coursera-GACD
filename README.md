## Introduction
Welcome to my "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera project!

The following files are available for you, the grader, in my github repo:

* README.md (this file)
* CodeBook.md
* run_analysis.R


## Readme.md
This README.md file is the top-level reference for this project.


## CodeBook.md
The CodeBook.md file contains information about the data: a brief description
of the raw data and where it came from, how I decided on which features of the
raw data to select for further processing into my tidy data set, a description
of my rationale for naming the variables in my tidy data set, and a plain-
English description of what each variable in the tidy data set is.


## run_analysis.R
The run_analysis.R file is my R script for taking the raw data and processing
it into tidy data. It is self-contained and fully-commented. No manual steps
are required. run_analysis.R will even download the raw data from the internet
if it is not already present on the local disk.

## tidy.txt
The tidy.txt file is not technically available to you in the github repo, but
it can be generated by running the run_analysis.R script. To load this file
into an R session, type the following:

```
  tidyData <- read.table(reportFile, header=TRUE)
```

For convenience the following lines are left as comments at the end of the
run_analysis.R script for loading the tidy.txt file into R and showing the
file contents:

```
  # As a test, read in a data frame
  #tidyData <- read.table(reportFile, header=TRUE)

  # Show the tidy data file to the person running this script
  #file.show(reportFile, header = reportFile)
```

Feel free to uncomment these and run the script to try it out!



Best Regards and Happy Coding,
